# Unlocking CFG Lock for Hackintosh

This GitHub repo will list a set of BIOS regions for you to use when unlocking your MSR registers in a locked BIOS with `modGRUBShell.efi`. 

These registers are being gathered from the latest BIOS version of the models specified (straight from the vendor's website), but it there's a problem with the BIOS version or your PC, open an issue or pull request with your info so I can find the register for your version.

If you want to contribute your system's register, feel free to! Open an issue or make a pull request with your changes and I'll add it to my list.
